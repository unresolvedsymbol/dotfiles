# ADBoot by Void - the solution to your bootloader woes
# Enter the Essential phone, which doesn't support the latest fastboot or USB 3.0,
# and has even lost countless devices to EDL or unrecoverable softbricks due
# to the bootloader still being locked. (flashing unlock and unlock_critical asap!)
# And if your argument against so is FRP, theres already a bypass: Security doesn't
# matter once someone has physical access of the device. If you're worried about your
# data, encrypt it. So lets stop killing the planet people :)

# Fucking "relock the bootloader for safety" headass essential
# Then being such a fucking failure of a company that OTAs hardbrick
