### Screenshots

### What's included
* Configurations for sway, mako, waybar, qutebrowser, foot, zsh, fzf, ranger, rifle, zathura, fonts, etc
* Crazy fast terminal tiling thanks to foot's server mode
* File based music player daemon (shmus)
* Screenshot script for sway with selection, display, window, and OCR capture support
* XDG replaced with rifle for files, uses $BROWSER for links
* Cross compatible login shell profiles (theoretically at least)
* Vanilla zsh configuration (OMZ is slow) with powerlevel10k, vim binds, mode indicators, and somewhat long hist file (<em>Sometimes I forget an obscure command I write once in a while</em>)
* Caps and escape swapped in sway and even vts! (<em>Set in zshrc, requires loadkeys setuid: security implications unknown</em>)
* Exa for ls (<em>Just cause</em>)
* Quick XBPS alias (<em>Also zsh only</em>)
* CMake projects auto install to local prefix (<em>so you don't have to sudo make install every goddamn program</em>)
* Other completely random zsh alias (<em>Including youtube-dl audio extractor, rot13, vv for sudo vim with env, etc etc</em>)
* Udisksctl based mounting (<em>Via over-engineered umt script and unfitting mnt alias</em>)

### TODO
Neomutt config
